        "### **Theoretical Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What are data structures, and why are they important?**  \n",
        "   - Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. They are important because they help in data management, optimize performance, and allow for efficient data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.**  \n",
        "   - **Mutable:** Can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).  \n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     my_list.append(4)  # Modifies the list\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Immutable:** Cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings, tuples).  \n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "     # my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will cause an error\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.  \n",
        "   - Lists have dynamic memory allocation, while tuples use less memory and are faster.  \n",
        "   - Lists are used for frequent modifications, whereas tuples ensure data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Describe how dictionaries store data.**  \n",
        "   - Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a **hash table**. The keys are hashed to find their corresponding values quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Sets remove duplicate values automatically and allow for faster membership testing (`in` operation).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**  \n",
        "   - A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is mutable and can store multiple data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Since tuples are immutable, their values cannot be changed after creation, ensuring data consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**  \n",
        "   - A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries use a hash table internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Can lists contain different data types in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Yes, a list can store integers, strings, tuples, other lists, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**  \n",
        "    - Strings are immutable for efficiency, security, and string interning, which optimizes memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**  \n",
        "    - Dictionaries provide faster lookups and data retrieval by key, whereas lists require linear searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**  \n",
        "    - If we need a fixed sequence of values, such as storing coordinates (`(x, y, z)`) or configuration settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Sets automatically remove duplicates when elements are added.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **How does the `in` keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**  \n",
        "    - For lists, it checks each element sequentially (O(n) time complexity). For dictionaries, it checks keys using a hash table (O(1) time complexity).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**  \n",
        "    - No, because tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.**  \n",
        "    - A dictionary inside another dictionary.  \n",
        "      ```python\n",
        "      student = {\n",
        "          \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
        "          \"grades\": {\"math\": 90, \"science\": 85}\n",
        "      }\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**  \n",
        "    - O(1) in average cases, O(n) in worst cases (due to hash collisions).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**  \n",
        "    - When the order of elements matters, or sequential data access is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**  \n",
        "    - Before Python 3.7, dictionaries didnâ€™t maintain insertion order. Since Python 3.7+, they do, but their key-value access remains O(1).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**  \n",
        "    - Lists require searching elements by index or iteration, while dictionaries provide direct key-based access.\n",
